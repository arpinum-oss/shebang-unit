**shebang-unit** is an automated testing framework for Bash 4 based on [xUnit].

Just download it here : *[releases/shebang-unit]*. Write a kata like *[examples/fizzbuzz]* and have fun!

With **shebang-unit** you can :
 * assert equality,
 * assert that string contains or not another string,
 * assert that array contains or not an element,
 * assert that status code is success or failure,
 * assert that command is successful or failing,
 * write setup or teardown functions for a test or a whole test file,
 * mock functions to speed up tests or enhance reliability,
 * view tests results with different kind of reports,
 * randomly execute tests to verify isolation,
 * save a baby kitten every time you use it!

Now you don't have any excuse for not practicing some sexy Test-Driven Development in Bash.

## Serious examples

### Basic equality for newbies

```bash
can_assert_equality() {
  assertion__equal 4 $((3+1))
}
```

### Awesome string assertions

```bash
can_assert_that_string_contains_another_one() {
  assertion__string_contains "Cool dog is cool" "cool"
}
```

```bash
can_assert_that_string_does_not_contain_another_one() {
  assertion__string_does_not_contain "Monorail cat" "Caturday"
}
```

```bash
can_assert_that_string_is_empty() {
  assertion__string_empty ""
}
```

```bash
can_assert_that_string_is_not_empty() {
  assertion__string_not_empty "Don't feed the zombies"
}
```

### Rocket science array assertions

```bash
can_assert_that_array_contains_element() {
  local lost_numbers=(4 8 15 16 23 42)

  assertion__array_contains 15 "${lost_numbers[@]}"
}
```

```bash
can_assert_that_array_does_not_contain_element() {
  local lost_numbers=(4 8 15 16 23 42)

  assertion__array_does_not_contain 1337 "${lost_numbers[@]}"
}
```

### Magic command assertions

```bash
can_assert_that_status_code_is_success() {
  true

  assertion__status_code_is_success $?
}
```

```bash
can_assert_that_status_code_is_failure() {
  false

  assertion__status_code_is_failure $?
}
```

```bash
can_assert_that_command_is_successful() {
  assertion__successful true
}
```

```bash
can_assert_that_command_is_failing() {
  assertion__failing false
}
```

### Mock in the Shell
> Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you.
> <cite>(Puppeteer, Ghost in the Shell)</cite>

```bash
can_mock_pwd_to_do_nothing() {
  mock__make_function_do_nothing "pwd"

  assertion__equal "" "$(pwd)"
}
```

```bash
can_mock_pwd_to_print_root() {
  mock__make_function_prints "pwd" "/"

  assertion__equal "/" "$(pwd)"
}
```

```bash
can_mock_pwd_to_call_a_custom_function() {
  mock__make_function_call "pwd" "printf hello"

  assertion__equal "hello" "$(pwd)"
}
```

## Usage

1. Copy *[releases/shebang-unit]* wherever you want,
2. Create a file suffixed by *_test.sh* like *math_test.sh* in *your_folder*,
3. Write a test function like in previous examples,
4. Run `./shebang-unit your_folder`,
5. Write production code,
6. Refactor. Enough said.

### Use another reporter

You can use another reporter with `-r` or `--reporters` options.

`./shebang-unit --reporters=dots`

The default reporter is called *simple*. It writes a verbose logging of test run to standard output.

You can use its little brother, the *dots* reporter which only displays dots (successful), S (skipped) or F (failing). Such a lazy cat.

If you are a rock star you can try the Ã¼ber JUnit reporter in combination with your favorite CI server (Jenkins?).

Here we use the JUnit reporter plus the dots one to display some log in the console.

`./shebang-unit --reporters=dots,junit`

The JUnit reporter creates a *junit_report.xml* file in your working directory. You can define another file with :

`./shebang-unit --reporters=junit --output-file=/tmp/i_love_ponies.xml`

### Use colors or no

You can use colors in test outputs with `-c` or `--colors` options. Colors are activated by default.

`./shebang-unit --colors=no your_folder`

### Run test files and functions randomly or no

You can run test files and functions randomly with `-d` or `--random-run` options. Runs are sorted by default.

`./shebang-unit --random-run=yes your_folder`

Test files are alphabetically ordered and functions are ordered from top to bottom by default. If you select a random run, test files are randomized then inside a file, each functions are randomized.

### Use another test file pattern

Test file pattern can be changed with `-f` or `--file-pattern` options. It can be convenient to run only few tests or totally change the default pattern (`*_test.sh`).

`./shebang-unit --file-pattern=this_only_test.sh your_folder`

`./shebang-unit --file-pattern=test_*.sh your_folder`

### Use another test function pattern

Test function pattern can be changed with `-t` or `--test-pattern` options. The default is `*` and can be changed if you want to focus on a couple of tests only.

`./shebang-unit --test-pattern=can_compare* your_folder`

## Convention over configuration

**sheban_unit** doesn't need any annotation to recognise a test function. Just write a *public* (see below) function like :

```bash
one_kitten_plus_another_is_equal_to_two_kittens() {
  ...
}

```

You can also use *private* functions to make your tests more explicit. Just prefix your functions by `_` :

```bash
my_super_explicit_test_use_private_functions() {
  _arrange_the_mess
  
  _act_like_a_pro
  
  _assert_some_stuff
}

_arrange_the_mess() {
  ...
}

...
```

### Build your own cathedral with setup or teardown functions

You can use special functions to arrange or clean the mess :

* `setup` : called before each test in a file
* `teardown` : called after each test in a file 
* `global_setup` : called once before all tests in a file
* `global_teardown` : called once after all tests in a file

## Pimp your **shebang-unit**

If you don't like **shebang-unit** coding conventions like function names or test file names, you can hack the global variables at the top of *shebang-unit.sh*.

For instance if your private functions are prefixed by `p_` for some reason :

```bash
SBU_PRIVATE_FUNCTION_NAME_REGEX="^p_.*"
```

Or, if you would rather live in dark and definitively turn off colors :

```bash
SBU_USE_COLORS="${SBU_NO}"
```

## Docker ##

Oh boy you can also run **shebang-unit** in a docker container. Just look at the [Docker documentation].
